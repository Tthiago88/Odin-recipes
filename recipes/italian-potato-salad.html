    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a classic Italian potato salad that can be found on tables from the north to the south. Meaning "parsley potatoes",

        school cafeterias. Buon appetito!

                Combine potatoes and salt in a large pot filled with cold water. Bring to a boil. Cook until potatoes are tender,
                but not mushy, about 10 minutes depending on size. Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle.

                While potatoes are cooking, whisk 3 tablespoons olive oil and white wine vinegar together in a small bowl.
                Add garlic and set aside.

                Peel cooked and cooled potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes. Combine potatoes, green onions, and parsley in a bowl and
                lightly toss. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil mixture and lightly toss, taking care not to break
                the potatoes.
